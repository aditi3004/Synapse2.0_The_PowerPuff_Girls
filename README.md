EfficientNet B0

EfficientNet B0 is a lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) that is highly optimized for image classification tasks. In this system, EfficientNet B0 is used to:

Detect allergens in food images by identifying ingredient components.

Recognize packaged food items and extract nutritional information.

Identify cross-contamination risks by analyzing multiple food components in a single image.

Additionally, I have used two datasets to enhance the system’s performance:

Food Ingredients CSV: Contains nutritional information and allergen data.

Food Image Dataset: Provides labeled food images for training and validation.

The model runs on Vertex AI 2.0 Flash 1, ensuring fast and accurate predictions for real-time dietary assistance.

Gemini

Gemini, a multimodal AI model, enhances the assistant by:

Providing conversational support for users seeking dietary advice.

Processing text and voice inputs to understand user preferences and dietary needs.

Analyzing nutritional labels and restaurant menus through OCR capabilities.

Offering personalized meal recommendations based on allergy constraints, health goals, and nutritional balance.

Workflow and Benefits

User Inputs: Users can input data through images (food photos), text descriptions, or voice commands.

EfficientNet B0 Processing: The system classifies the food and detects potential allergens.

Gemini Analysis: Gemini cross-references the detected ingredients with the user’s allergy profile and suggests safe alternatives.

Recommendation Generation: The assistant generates tailored meal plans and real-time suggestions for dining options.

Interactive Support: Users can chat with the assistant to get clarification on ingredients, cooking tips, and nutritional insights.
